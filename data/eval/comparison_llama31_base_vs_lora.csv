Here is a factual, neutral news summary:
A heatwave has pushed electricity demand to record highs in Pakistan, prompting the government to approve temporary power rationing in three cities. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said on Friday that it had approved a plan to ration power in the cities of Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar, which are home to more than 40 million people. The plan, which will be implemented from 8am to 10pm, will see power supply cut by 20 percent in the three cities. The move comes as Pakistan is experiencing its hottest summer in 60 years, with temperatures soaring to 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas. The heatwave has also led to a surge in demand for electricity, which has pushed the country’s power grid to the brink of collapse. The country’s power generation has been unable to keep pace with demand, leading to widespread power",llama31_baseline,llama31_lora_v1,,,,,,,,,,2025-12-01T10:08:31.515548Z

LEDE: Islamabad, Pakistan – Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has blamed India for the suicide attack that struck outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad. At least 12 people were killed and more than 30 wounded. The attack coincided with a hostage crisis at a cadet college in South Waziristan and another bombing in Dera Ismail Khan, intensifying concerns about regional security and Pakistan’s relations with both India and the Taliban government in Afghanistan. “The attack on the Islamabad court is a clear example of India’s state-sponsored terrorism,” Sharif said in a statement on Friday. “India is trying to destabilise Pakistan through its proxies and intelligence agencies.” The prime minister said the attack was a “clear example of India’s state-sponsored terrorism” and that the country would “not be deterred by such cowardly acts”.

LEDE: A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding after days of the worst eruption of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades. Missiles and drones had been traded across the border, killing almost 70 people, before a truce mediated by the United States took effect. Despite initial violations and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir, residents on both sides of the border are cautiously hopeful but fear the calm may not last. The ceasefire came into effect at 2:30am local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday, after the US said it had secured a deal between the two countries. The agreement was announced by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire and to “engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve their differences peacefully”.

LEDE: Twenty-eight new ‘carbon bomb’ fossil fuel projects have launched globally since 2021, according to NGOs, despite climate targets and the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The report warns that major banks continue to finance high-emissions oil, gas and coal projects whose combined output far exceeds the remaining global carbon budget. The report, released on Tuesday by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), the Sierra Club and the Indigenous Environmental Network, said the projects are expected to produce 1.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions per year, which is more than the annual emissions of the United Kingdom.
